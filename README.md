The overall workflow of MP-MIM is illustrated as above, which includes three main parts: (A) data preprocessing of converting input embedding into graph-structured data, (B) embedding transformation by massage passing, and (C) embedding evaluation using Moran’s I with maximum filtering and output the transformed embeddings and ranking.
